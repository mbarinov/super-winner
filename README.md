# Hey, Welcome to Ecwid! 👋

This is a Vue 3 project I built with TypeScript and Vite. Hope you like it!

## ✨ What's Inside

I've put together a modern stack that makes development fun:

- **Vue 3** with the awesome Composition API
- **TypeScript** for those sweet type hints
- **Vite** because nobody likes waiting for builds
- **Pinia** for easy state management
- **Vue Router** for seamless navigation
- **TailwindCSS** for quick styling without the hassle
- **TanStack Vue Query** to handle all that data-fetching magic
- **Vitest & Playwright** so we can sleep well knowing everything works

## 📁 How It's Organized

I've tried to keep things logical and easy to find:

```
src/
├── assets/      # Images, fonts, and global styles
├── components/  # All the reusable UI pieces
├── composables/ # Shared Vue logic hooks
├── router/      # Navigation setup
├── services/    # API calls and external integrations
├── stores/      # State management with Pinia
└── views/       # The main page components
```

## 🚀 GitHub Codespaces

This project is ready for GitHub Codespaces! You can start coding immediately with:

1. Go to your GitHub repository

The environment will set up automatically with all necessary dependencies and extensions.
